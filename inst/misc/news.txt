0.2.0
	'..tables' now returns an empty vector when there is no table in environment
	consequently all '!is.null' on input$main.data have to be replaced by '..isNotEmpty'.
	Added a parameter to remove the creation of example tables.
0.2.1
	Removed dependence to package methods.
	Added the creation date in 'tables' page.
	Disabled use of 'crayon' to prevent using escape sequence in table previews.
	Web browser is now lauched in any case : RStudio window doesn't work.
	Fixed chaotic display of the list of tables after adding a new one.
	Fixed temporary error message on some not still used pages.
	'contents': enhanced page to display all the classes of a column.
	'view': fixed grouping that put page selection in error.
	'tables': fixed log creation.
	'reclass': fixed count of changed columns when one has more than one class (e.g. time or command in log).
	'filter': fixed invalid test for grouping when function has no 2nd argument.
	'summarise': fixed '.name' not found.
	'gather' with 'pivot_longer' and type selection: fixed missing 'where' in new versions of tidyr.
	'spread': fixed missing duplicated keys test with a specific ..try. That caused command to crash IGoR (e.g. nanopop, k=sexe,v=age)
	Removed skim_with call that was not called at the user level.
0.2.2
	Added references in NAMESPACE to prevent NOTEs on certain machines.
	Removed error messages appearing after deleting all the tables with a graphic or tabular page activated.
	All icons replaced. Access to www.insee.fr removed.
