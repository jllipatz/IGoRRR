Description: 
  Launches a shiny application generating code to
    view tables in several ways,
    import/export tables,
    modify tables,
    make some basic graphics.
  'IGoR' is a graphic user interface designed to help beginners
  using simple functions around table management and exploration.
  Inspired by 'Rcmdr', 'IGoR' is a code generator that, with simple inputs under a Shiny application,
  provides R code mainly built around the 'tidyverse' or some packages in the direct line of the Mosaic project:
  the 'rio' and 'ggformula' packages.
  The generated code doesn't depend on IGoR and can be manually modified by the user or copied elsewhere.
